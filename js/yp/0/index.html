    <p class="lead">This animation visualises the complex workings of an electromagnetic field. It features flux lines that vividly depict the path of the field, emanating from the positive and negative poles of magnets or circuits. As a visually engaging representation of invisible forces at work, the animation allows observers to comprehend how electromagnetic fields shape the movement of charged particles or influence other electric or magnetic fields. It vividly showcases the intricacies of phenomena such as field interactions and wave propagation, making abstract concepts tangible and easy to understand.</p>
